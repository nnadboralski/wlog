# wlog

wlog (worklog) is a small utility to track tasks in command line. I use this
for things I work on and need to submit a list of stuff done on a particular 
day.

Disclaimer: Some of the things in this software assume an ANSI terminal. So you
might get weird characters if you're not on an ANSI terminal. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'wlog'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wlog

## Usage

On command line write

    wlog

And you should be in a command line interface. In the interface you can type in

    help

To see a list of actions that you can do.
